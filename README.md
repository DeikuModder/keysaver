<h1>Keysaver</h1>

<p>Keysaver is a simple desktop app, wich only purpose is for you to save your passwords in a space where you can have them organized, and at least a little bit secure behind a password for the app, or security questions, since it's completely offline, you don't have to worry of any hacking online, but keep in mind that if someone can have access to your pc, it's possible that the information you save in the app would be compromised.</p>

<h3>"Is it not the same of making a .txt file and find a way to protect it with a password?"</h3>

<p>Yes, but this looks cooler, and you can change the theme :b</p>
